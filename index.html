    During the lockdown in March 2020 we began selling old clothes as a hobby which quickly turned into developing a passion for vintage clothing. As such we rebranded our page to Quiet Riot Vintage and began selling vintage clothing mainly forcusing on the 90's and early 2000's. In that time our brand changed a lot as we diverted our attention to promoting the sustainability of buying vintage and stopping fast fashion while also providing unique stylish selection of clothing for our customers.  </p> 
    
    <br>
<p> Over the course of 3 years we have had hundreds of orders and over a hundred 5 star reviews from our lovely customers.</p>

<h3>Our mission</h3></div>
<div>
<p> Our ultimate goal is to raise awareness of Fast fashion and put an end to fashion waste. Fast fashion is a design, manufacturing, and marketing method focused on rapidly producing high volumes of clothing often produced by brands that only sell cheaply made clothing, brands like Prettylittlething, Boohoo, Primark etc, all contribute to fast fashion and in turn become a totally unethical company by putting profits over good quality clothing that will last years. Often items bought from fast fashion companies are so badly and cheaply made that they don't last more than a few weeks and often just get sent to landfill, polluting the world more and more each day. <br>
So how can you change that? By buying clothes to last! Buying from ethical companies who promote Slow Fashion, who use recycled materials to create clothing, who don't run 80% off sales every single day to just get rid of stock and don't churn out thousands of new items weekly.Buying vintage is a great way to help stop fashion waste as most clothing that is vintage was made by companies who prioritized the longevity of clothing, items were very rarely made with poor quality materials and mass made as people didn't want to constantly shop for new clothes instead they bought a couple of pricey pieces and made it last 20+ years by taking care of them. </p>
